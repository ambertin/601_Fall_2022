## Education/Work Background

Completed undergraduate degree in 2021 from Smith College in Statistical and Data Sciences (essentially, applied statistics). Currently a masters student in Computer Science at UMass.

On top of school, I work full time as a data scientist at MassMutual, primarily building predictive models in Python.


## R experience

Used R in a few statistics/data science courses at Smith College so have some familiarity with tidyverse and the statistics functions. However, it's been a few years since I last used it regularly and there are lots of features I haven't learned yet, both old things that I never learned before as well as new features like across()/quarto documents. I am hoping to both get a refresher on what I've forgotten as well as learn about some new functions and features I've not seen before.


## Research interests

- How to do "good" science (reproducible results, open access, etc)
- Algorithmic bias
- Public policy/law around data and responsible technology use

## Hometown

Born and Raised in Austin, TX (until college). Just moved to Boston, MA!

## Hobbies

- 35mm film photography
- Electric skateboarding
- Video games and board games
- Hiking/camping/outdoor stuff more generally
- Rock climbing

## Fun fact

I have many fun facts but one is that I am a former Texas state champion at competitive map reading.
